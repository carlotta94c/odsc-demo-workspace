# My Python Notebook

This project provides a workspace for a Jupyter Python notebook with a GitHub Codespaces configuration. It includes the installation of pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries.

## Setup

1. Open this project in GitHub Codespaces. This will automatically create a development container with all the necessary dependencies installed.

2. Once the Codespace is ready, open the terminal and navigate to the `notebooks` directory.

3. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter notebook server.

4. Open `my_notebook.ipynb` to start working on the notebook.

## Usage

You can use this notebook to write and run Python code. The pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries are already installed, so you can import them directly into your code.

For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

You can also add markdown cells to document your code and explain your analysis.

Remember to save your changes before closing the notebook.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

These packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and are automatically installed when the Codespace is created.

If you want to add more packages, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file and rebuild the Codespace.
