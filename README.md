# Supercharging your data science projects with GitHub Tools

This repository contains the code for the [Supercharging your data science projects with GitHub Tools](https://app.aiplus.training/courses/Supercharging-your-Data-Science-projects-with-GitHub-tools) course on [AI+ Training](https://app.aiplus.training/).

This project has been created by customizing an AI generated workspace template. To get a similar template for your own projects, you can use the **@workspace** agent on [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat), together with the **/new** command.

Learn more about this and other features covered in the webinar by reading the [accompanying blog post](https://opendatascience.com/supercharging-your-data-science-projects-with-github-tools/).

The Python code in the 'my_notebook' Jupyter notebook is extracted from the Microsoft Learn Tutorial [Exercise - Train and evaluate a regression model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/train-evaluate-regression-models/3-exercise-model).

## Tools

To get the tools used in this webinar, follow these steps:

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your machine
2. Sign up for a [GitHub Copilot free trial](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup/?WT.mc_id=academic-111460-cacaste) 
3. Install [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot), [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) and [GitHub Copilot Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extensions on VS Code.

To execute the Jupyter Notebook on **the Cloud**, leveraging [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces/), click on the button below:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=716058762)

This will open your pre-configured environment on the browser.

## Project description

> **Note: The project description below has been generated by GitHub Copilot.**

This project provides a workspace for a Jupyter Python notebook with a GitHub Codespaces configuration. It includes the installation of pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries.

### Setup

1. Open this project in GitHub Codespaces. This will automatically create a development container with all the necessary dependencies installed.

2. Once the Codespace is ready, open the terminal and navigate to the `notebooks` directory.

3. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter notebook server.

4. Open `my_notebook.ipynb` to start working on the notebook.

### Usage

You can use this notebook to write and run Python code. The pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries are already installed, so you can import them directly into your code.

For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

You can also add markdown cells to document your code and explain your analysis.

Remember to save your changes before closing the notebook.

### Dependencies

This project uses the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

These packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and are automatically installed when the Codespace is created.

If you want to add more packages, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file and rebuild the Codespace.
